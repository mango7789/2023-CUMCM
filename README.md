## 2023 CUMCM Problem B

This repository contains all MATLAB codes, images, and our paper for **Problem B** in the 2023 CUMCM.    
Although this was our first time competing in such a modeling contest, we are proud to have won a **second prize** in the Shanghai competition area.

#### Problem Breakdown

1. Establish a mathematical model for the coverage width of multi-beam bathymetry and the overlap rate between adjacent strips.
2. Develop a mathematical model for the multi-beam bathymetry coverage width for a given direction $\beta$ and a specified rectangular area.
3. Design a group of measurement lines with the shortest total length under the given overlap rate condition.
4. Design measurement lines based on given sea water depth data in an Excel file under some constraints.
